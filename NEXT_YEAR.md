# Process changes for next year

* Rethink how the ideas are grouped. The way this has year has worked out, the aims are bucketed and I'm just doing one thing at a time from each bucket. It'd be easier to manage if I made that part of the process for next year.
* Maybe don't try to decide the whole list up front. I like being changeable.
* Goals for every 2 weeks, every 2 months and every 4 months seems about right.

# Ideas for next year.

1. Learn the drums
1. Get better at piano
1. Learn to do a piercing whistle
1. Learn the Colemak keyboard layout
1. Go to an improv comedy class
1. Start typing making sure I press shift with the hand that isn't doing the letter (this feels like it slows me down a lot)
1. Do x talks at y conferences
1. Stop saying "cool" and "yeah". The generation above find it odd, the generation below find it out of touch.
1. `EDN` Go to the Edinburgh Fringe
