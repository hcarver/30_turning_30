# 30 Turning 30

30 things I'm going to achieve in the year I turn 30.

There are actually 33 things here, but that's so that I can fail at some of them or change my mind about doing them, but still make it to 30 overall. Some of them have external dependencies, so I might end up failing despite my best efforts.
