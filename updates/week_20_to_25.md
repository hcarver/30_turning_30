# Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

Argh, so long since the last update. Poor show.

1. `WUT` Wuthering Heights starts *so badly*. Luckily, it gets better after the first 30 pages, and turns out to be worth the effort.
1. `GAM` I've actually started planning this in earnest.
1. `FLT` I marked this as done before, but all of my spare time in the last few weeks has gone into moving into, and improving the flat, so I thought it was worth writing about it again.
