# Weeks 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36

11 weeks in one. With the benefit of hindsight, this project seems filled with
hubris. Lots of things I aimed to do this year were *much* larger than I thought they would be, or turned out to really
be 2 or more separate aims in one.

At the same time, a lot of the things I intended to do, now seem unimportant, uninteresting or unobtainable.
For example, I don't have much interest in "`AJS` Make a little live forum / chat site with Angular / the MEAN stack" - I think
I mainly put it on the list because it seemed like the sort of thing I should be doing. And my target of "`5KM` Run 5km in 24 minutes (current PB is 26:30)" feels _waaaay_ beyond me, to the extent that it actually makes me run less - it's demotivating to have goals that are impossible.

Realising these things feels good.

From now, I'm going to be free and easy with adding and removing stuff from the list.
If I do this again next year, I'll set goals for no more than 3 months ahead. And make sure to get a better balance of the size of them.

1. `WUT` ✓ Read Wuthering Heights - it was good. One annoying character, some weird religious-pagan mysticism and some relationships that feel like they are far too complicated to be real life - but maybe that's the charm of the book.
1. `OOT` ✓ Finish playing Ocarina of Time. Amazing. Would play again, and probably will.
1. `FRD` ✓ Rekindle a friendship that's lapsed. This happened unexpectedly, which made it all the nicer.
1. `LUD` ✓ Have a technology-free day - I really meant an Internet-free day. It wasn't that hard.
1. `WIF` ✓ Marry my fiancee. This was my fave.
1. `HNY` ✓ Organise and go on honeymoon - lots of time went into organising this, so I think it deserves its own spot on the list.
