# Week 13 and 14

Sometimes, Sunday evenings are too busy to write an update.

1. `SUP` Been thinking about this a bit more.
1. `AJS` Started playing with this. Been trying to think of a simple little game I could make with it.
1. `HFM` Lots of running. Couldn't walk for half a day. Did another big run, then couldn't walk again.
1. `WIF` Been doing quite a lot of work on this lately.
1. `CLM` Started organising this.
1. `FLT` Possibly some progress on this at long last!
