# Weeks 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

So many weeks but some actual progress to show for it.

1. `WUT` Just started reading it.
1. `OPS` ✓ Yes! Not quite as high profile as Rails, but I've now [contributed to a Game of Thrones-based game that a friend runs](https://github.com/tijptjik/ascension/pull/24). It was fun working out how the app's put together, what wasn't working, and how to test my fix.
1. `SUP` Been doing some early writing for this. Still a way off being done.
1. `HFM` ✓ Yes! [I ran the Hackney half-marathon a week ago](http://results.sporthive.com/events/6130285947763579904/races/377978/bib/2362). It was *very* hard and a v hot day. But look! I overtook 350 people in the second half.
1. `FLT` ✓ Yes! After putting in our offer in September, we've now exchanged contracts, so I have actually bought a flat. We start moving in this week.
