# Week 10 and 11

I forgot to write an update last week, and the outcry has been tremendous. Here's two weeks' worth in one go.

1. `JEY` Stil reading it. It's still good, and I'm nearly at the end. Lots of peril and uncertainty. Fingers crossed for a happy ending, reader.
1. `ZEL` 1 dungeon from the end. Classic.
1. `HFM` It's been a good couple of weeks for running.
1. `FLT` More progress. Apparently we're just waiting for the local council to get their act together now.
