# Week 4

In which I went running.

1. `BIT` I really am in the final straight now with the knitting. Bit now has a proper name too, which is very exciting! Still haven't met her yet though.
1. `HFM` Did a couple of training runs for the half-marathon, including running 11km, which is a PB for the furthest distance I've ever run ever.
1. `5KM` One of this week's runs was also a PB for my fastest 5km time (but only just).
1. `WSB` Continuing to stay on the wagon. Only a couple more weeks...
