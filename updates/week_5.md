# Week 5

One big completion, hurrah!

1. `BIT` âœ“ I finished the knitting for Bit! It actually looks quite good which is lucky, given how much time I've spent on it.
1. `HFM` Only 2 training runs, but I had really sore feet for most of the week but I've bought expensive new shoes that should help with that. You've got to speculate to accelerate, or something.
1. `WSB` Still teetotal on Wasabi's tofu curry despite severe temptation this week.

### Revisions:

1. I added a new aim for next year, that when typing capital letters I force myself to press Shift with the other hand than the letter I'm pressing. I think this will have a suprprisingly strongi effect on my typing.
