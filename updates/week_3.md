# Week 3

A slow week.

1. `SPO` I've now got a copy of the DVD of 2001 A Space Odyssey.
1. `JEY` I've now got a copy of Jane Eyre too!
1. `WUT` And Wuthering Heights. This doesn't feel like progress, it feels like cheating!
1. `BOK` I've added a new item to the list: write a book about running startups. This is something I've been intending to do for a long time, so 2016 will be the year!
1. `BIT` Bit was born on Thursday 21st! The family are all doing well, and I've spent a lot of time on finishing the knitting and made a lot of progress. Should be able to finish within the next week.
1. `HFM` Terrible week for running. I pulled something in my foot, so I only managed to do 2 runs this week.
1. `WSB` Another week of going cold turkey without any Wasabi, and I'm coping.
1. `FLT` Big setback this week that's too boring to describe here :( Fingers crossed that it won't derail the whole thing.
