# Week 6

I'm really enjoying this project. And I've inspired at least one other person to do their own, which is cool.

1. `JEY` Started reading Jane Eyre. It's actually quite good.
1. `HFM` Foot pains continue, so I had a week of resting. Going to reboot the running on Monday.
1. `WSB` âœ“ Finished my month without Wasabi, and tried it again the following day. I mainly stopped for a month to see whether I was really addicted or not. I think I probably wasn't, because it wasn't that hard. I do like MSG though.

### Revisions:

None.
