# Week 12

More completed challenges, and some new ones begun.

1. `JEY` ✓ Reader, I got tired of making the same reference to a famous line
from Jane Eyre.
1. `ZEL` ✓ Zelda was really great. There's much less signposting to the player
of what you're meant to do next. I ended up drawing my own map for the overworld
and more, which made it less portable than I'd been hoping, given that I was
playing on a 3DS.
1. `SUP` Started writing down some thoughts about this. Early days.
1. `HFM` More running. Run run run run run.
1. `WIF` More progress.
