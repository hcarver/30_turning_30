# Week 2

First achievement unlocked!

* `ZEL` Downloaded and started. It's dangerous to go alone.
* `BIT` Done quite a lot of knitting this week, and I'm getting close to finishing the basic outfit. There's quite a bit of ornamentation to do after that. ~2 weeks til birth.
* `HFM` Terrible week. My phone switched itself off overnight so I overslept and missed a training run, and only did 3.
* `5KM` Obviously affected by the above. Did quite a bad time (27:15) but luckily I forgot my barcode, so it's not registered against my name.
* `WSB` I had a Wasabi for lunch on Monday and 3 different people who've seen this project tried to stage an intervention (which I appreciate a lot). So that'll be my last one for a month. It was on 11 January.
* `DVK` Done! I've been using it for a solid two weeks. It's hard to explain but it *feels* nicer than QWERTY somehow.
* `WIF` Did some small odds and sods towards our wedding.
