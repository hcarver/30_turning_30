# Week 1

1 week in and I've made some early progress.

* `BIT` Spent a couple of hours on the knitting for Bit, though there's still a long way to go before the end of January.
* `HFM` I've been on 4 training runs to start getting ready for this.
* `DVK` I've been using Dvorak keyboard solidly for the last week.
* `WIF` Trying to do my share of the planning and organising (realistically, I'm still doing less than half).
