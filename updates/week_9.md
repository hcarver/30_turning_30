# Week 9

A man kicked me on the train today. True story.

This week has been serendipitous and filled with progress. It's also made me realise how much I want to change my list from when I started. It'd make much more sense to have fortnightly, 2 monthly and 4 monthly things (or something like that).

1. `JEY` Still reading Jane Eyre, it's good but I'm not fast at reading it.
1. `ZEL` Having a great time playing Zelda and drawing a map to help.
1. `GAM` Serendipitously started this with a friend, based on their suggestions.
1. `HFM` Still running
1. `5KM` I shaved a little bit of my PB, reducing it from 26:30 to 25:40. Still a way to go to get to the target.



#### Education

Things to learn.

1. `JPN` Learn a bit of Japanese
1. `SNG` Have a singing lesson
1. `BSH` Get better at Bash and give a talk on it too
1. `DVK` âœ“ Use Dvorak keyboard for a solid 2 weeks

#### Personal

Things in my personal life.

1. `FRD` Rekindle a friendship that's lapsed (TBD which one)
1. `LUD` Have a technology-free day
1. `EDN` Go to the Edinburgh Fringe
1. `CLD` Host a murder mystery party
1. `WIF` Marry my fiancee (most of the groundwork done on this one, TBH, but still a lot of organisation to go)
1. `FLT` Buy a flat
