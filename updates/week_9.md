# Week 9

A man kicked me on the train today. True story.

This week has been serendipitous and filled with progress. It's also made me realise how much I want to change my list from when I started. It'd make much more sense to have fortnightly, 2 monthly and 4 monthly things (or something like that).

I added playing in a band to the list.

1. `JEY` Still reading Jane Eyre, it's good but I'm not fast at reading it.
1. `ZEL` Having a great time playing Zelda and drawing a map to help.
1. `GAM` Serendipitously started this with a friend, based on their suggestions.
1. `HFM` Still running
1. `5KM` I shaved a little bit of my PB, reducing it from 26:30 to 25:40. Still a way to go to get to the target.
1. `FLT` Some progress here! Still sorting legal stuff, but it's closer to done than it was before.
